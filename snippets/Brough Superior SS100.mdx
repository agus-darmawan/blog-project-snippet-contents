# Brough Superior SS100

The Brough Superior SS100 is a motorcycle that commands reverence and admiration within the world of classic motorcycling. Dubbed the "Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles," this machine represents the pinnacle of early 20th-century motorcycle engineering and design. Created by George Brough in the 1920s, the SS100 was not only a technological marvel of its time but also a symbol of luxury, performance, and craftsmanship that continues to captivate enthusiasts to this day.

## Historical Context and Creation

The Brough Superior SS100 was introduced in 1924, during a period when motorcycles were rapidly evolving from utilitarian vehicles into high-performance machines. George Brough, an innovator and perfectionist, aimed to create a motorcycle that would surpass all others in terms of speed, quality, and elegance. The "SS" in SS100 stands for "Super Sports," and the "100" signifies that each model was guaranteed to reach 100 miles per hour, a remarkable feat for its era.

## Engineering Excellence

At the heart of the SS100 was its engine, which varied over the years but typically featured a V-twin configuration. These engines were sourced from renowned manufacturers like JAP (J. A. Prestwich Industries) and Matchless, and they were meticulously tuned and tested by Brough himself. The combination of a powerful engine and a lightweight, rigid frame made the SS100 an extraordinarily fast and agile motorcycle.

The engineering of the SS100 extended beyond its engine. Brough Superior motorcycles were known for their innovative use of materials and design elements. For instance, the SS100 featured a distinctive, nickel-plated gas tank, a robust and beautifully crafted frame, and high-quality suspension components that provided superior handling and comfort. Each bike was custom-built to the specifications of its owner, ensuring that no two SS100s were exactly alike.

```python
# Example Python code
def brough_superior_performance(speed, weight):
    """
    Calculate the performance score of a Brough Superior SS100.
    
    Args:
    speed (int): The top speed of the motorcycle in mph.
    weight (int): The weight of the motorcycle in pounds.
    
    Returns:
    float: Performance score calculated as speed/weight ratio.
    """
    performance_score = speed / weight
    return performance_score

# Example usage
top_speed = 100  # in mph
motorcycle_weight = 390  # in pounds
performance = brough_superior_performance(top_speed, motorcycle_weight)
print(f"The performance score of the Brough Superior SS100 is {performance:.2f}")
```
### Performance and Prestige
The performance of the SS100 was legendary. In 1925, George Brough himself set a world record by riding an SS100 at a speed of 122 miles per hour. The motorcycle was also a favorite among racers and speed enthusiasts, cementing its reputation on the track as well as on the road. Its speed, reliability, and superior engineering made it the choice of discerning riders who sought the best.

However, the Brough Superior SS100 was not just about raw performance; it was also about prestige. Owning an SS100 was a statement of wealth and taste. The motorcycle was often compared to high-end luxury cars of the time, and it attracted a clientele that included celebrities, aristocrats, and even T. E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence famously owned several Brough Superiors and praised their performance and build quality.

### Legacy and Modern Revival
The production of the Brough Superior SS100 ceased in the 1940s, but its legacy endured. The motorcycle became a sought-after collector's item, with surviving examples fetching high prices at auctions and being displayed in museums around the world. The SS100's blend of speed, craftsmanship, and exclusivity ensured its place in the annals of motorcycle history.

In recent years, the Brough Superior brand has been revived, and new versions of the SS100 have been produced, blending modern technology with the classic design and spirit of the original. These contemporary models pay homage to George Brough's vision while incorporating advancements in materials and engineering, ensuring that the SS100 continues to inspire and excite new generations of riders.
